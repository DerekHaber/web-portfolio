                                          Hey there Hackers! Are you interested in continued education into another field of Cyber Security? If so, it's about time you check out TryHackMe's new <a href='https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/security-engineer-training'>Security Engineer Path</a>
                                          <br>
                                          First off, let me dive into TryHackMe's model a little bit. From here on out, I'll refer to them as THM. THM is a learning and Capture The Flag platform for people in every level of cyber security, from a total beginner, to a 15 year cyber security professional. Anyone and everyone can learn something from THM, and put their skills to the tests with different security rooms in hardening, privilege escalation, exploitation, or at times all of the above! They also have a competitive program called King of the Hill, where hackers compete against eachother to both exploit, and then protect a machine for the longest time.
                                          <br>
                                          <br>
                                          Now into this new path. THM's Security Engineer path covers a broad range of subjects, from general security principles, basics of cryptography (encryption and encoding of data), regulations, risk management, and even hardening of the systems themselves. It covers security priciples for networks, systems, and software, and covers what steps to take before, during, and after an incident.
                                          <br>
                                          <br>
					  Another great thing about this path is the hands on application of tools. They guide you through the meaning and context of different tools and paths, allowing the user to not only understand the tool to use, but why they use it, what it does, and what options they have for different results. Some examples are gpg and openssl for encryption, iptables for firewall configuration, tail and grep to search for specific information, and much more! Even better, the tools you are taught to use in this path translate over to other aspects of cyber security, as well as just good system administration. Having a good understaning of these networks, systems, and applications can help you in your career no matter where you are in IT.

                                          THM's Security Engineer learning path are set up in an easy-to-follow, beginner friendly manner, which allows for anyone to grasp on to the information, and have a good understanding. On top of this, THM gives you labs and machines to test your newfound knowledge practically, and get the hands-on experience (because no one wants just book knowledge).
                                          <br>
                                          <br>
                                          In short, THM has provided us with a great, beginner friendly learning opportunity for those interested in cyber security, and those hoping to pursue a career as a Security Engineer. On top of that, it is an entertaining pasttime for hobbyist and enthusiats alike, hoping to hone their skills and seek constant improvement.
